This is for recording my GSoC 2019. You can find my GSoC project web page in [Google Summer of Code 2019][GSoC-2019].

# What I've done
* DRM core ioctl decoding:
   * Almost all core ioctls are decoded.
   * Those ioctl which are nooped in the latest kernel are marked as noop in strace, too.
* Decoding of device-specific DRM ioctls (mostly demos, rework needed):
   * i915.
   * i810.
   * nouveau.
   * amdgpu.

# Links
* N/A

# TODO
* Investigate those noop ioctls to see whether they are worth decoding in
old kernels because strace supports kernel 2.6.18+.
* Make those demo good enough to be merged.
